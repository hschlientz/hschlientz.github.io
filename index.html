					<h2>Dog Safety on the Boat</h2>
					<p>
						The safety of the dog is paramount when boating. Before the dog is
						allowed to swim, make sure that the propeller is off and the engine
						area has stopped running.
					</p>
					<p>
						Always monitor your dog's exposure to the sun and make sure they are
						always hydrated.
					</p>

					<h3>Landlubber Dogs</h3>
					<p>
						Some dogs are not meant to boat. Any dog that cannot handle the heat
						(e.g., bulldogs) can find boating uncomfortable. Dogs can get
						seasick, so if your dog is drooling or vomiting, maybe they are more
						comfortable as a landlubber!
